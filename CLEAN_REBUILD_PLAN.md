# Clean Rebuild Plan: New Repo with Good Architecture

## Goal
Build a high-quality personal portfolio site with contact form functionality from scratch, using good architecture principles and leveraging AI generation with human review.

## âœ… New Repository Setup

### 1. âœ… Create Template Repository
```bash
# Create new repo: adam-edison-portfolio-v2
mkdir adam-edison-portfolio-v2
cd adam-edison-portfolio-v2
git init
```

### 2. ðŸš§ Foundation Setup (Day 1: 2-3 hours)

* âœ… 1-husky-for-commit-messages
* âœ… 2-next-js-with-pages-router-and-tailwind
* ðŸš§ 3-eslint-and-prettier
* ðŸš§ 4-basic-landing-page
  * and here is where we introduce:
    * Agents in personal Claude for:
      * whole process coordination for new code given requirements
      * Software Architect -- Clean Architecture, review first, several steps along the way, generates skeleton after approval
      * Software Product Engineer -- asks questions to clarify requirements and acceptance criteria before writing tests
      * Software Test Engineer -- DI for everything, and mocking class methods where needed, writes tests as TDD
      * Software Implementation Engineer -- write production code in the skeleton to make tests pass, iterating until tests pass
      * Refactoring Engineer -- code style and quality checks
      * Last Line of Defense -- run all quality checks (format, lint, tests, build, server starts, .env.example is complete)
* 5-contact-page
    * Agents in personal Claude:
      * Security Engineer -- make recommendations to improve security if needed and make MD file with high, medium, low risks -- add to existing file or create new one in project .claude folder
      * security md file not in version control
* 6-email-integration
* 7-rate-limiting
* 8-anti-bot-measures
* 9-security-improvements
* 10-accessibility-improvements
* 11-performance-improvements
* 12-favicon
* 13-netlify-deployment

## Architecture Principles

### Component Architecture
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose
- **Composition**: Build complex UI from simple components
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage
- **Testability**: Components easy to test in isolation

### Service Architecture  
- **Separation of Concerns**: UI, business logic, data access separated
- **Dependency Injection**: Services easily mockable and testable
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling patterns
- **Configuration**: Environment-based configuration

### Security Architecture
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers
- **Input Validation**: All inputs validated and sanitized
- **Rate Limiting**: Multiple rate limiting strategies
- **Secure by Default**: Secure configurations as default

## Quality Process

### AI Generation + Human Review Loop
For each feature:
1. **Generate**: AI creates initial implementation
2. **Review**: Identify what you like/dislike
3. **Refine**: Update requirements and regenerate
4. **Repeat**: Until code meets your standards
5. **Document**: Capture patterns for future use

### Quality Gates
Each phase must pass:
- [ ] **Functionality**: Features work as intended
- [ ] **Code Quality**: Clean, readable, maintainable code
- [ ] **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript compliance
- [ ] **Testing**: Appropriate test coverage
- [ ] **Performance**: No performance regressions
- [ ] **Security**: Security review (for security features)

### Documentation
Maintain throughout development:
- **Architecture Decisions**: Why choices were made
- **Component Patterns**: Reusable patterns discovered
- **API Documentation**: Clear API contracts
- **Deployment Guide**: How to deploy and configure

## Expected Timeline

**Total: 12 days (2.5 weeks)**
- **Phase 1**: Days 1-2 (Foundation)
- **Phase 2**: Days 3-4 (Contact Form)
- **Phase 3**: Days 5-7 (Security)
- **Phase 4**: Days 8-10 (Advanced Features)
- **Phase 5**: Days 11-12 (Polish & Deploy)

## Success Metrics

### Technical Quality
- Clean, maintainable codebase
- Full TypeScript coverage
- Comprehensive security
- Excellent performance
- Well-tested functionality

### Process Quality
- Refined AI generation prompts

- Fast, responsive user experience

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **Complex integrations**: Start simple, add complexity gradually
- **Security vulnerabilities**: Security review at each phase
- **Performance issues**: Regular performance testing

### Process Risks
- **Scope creep**: Stick to defined phases
- **Over-engineering**: Focus on simplicity first
- **Time overruns**: Time-box each feature

## Next Steps

1. **Create Repository**: Set up new repo with foundation
2. **Phase 1 Start**: Begin with home page rendering
3. **Iterate**: Use AI generation + human review loop
4. **Document**: Capture learnings for future phases
5. **Progress**: Move through phases systematically

This plan provides a structured approach to building a high-quality site from scratch while leveraging your existing work as reference material and using AI to accelerate development with human oversight ensuring quality.
