# Feature-Driven Rebuild Plan

## Core Philosophy

**Rules evolve from building features, not the other way around.**

Each feature branch becomes a laboratory for:
- Testing AI generation quality
- Refining prompts until output meets your standards
- Evolving coding rules based on real code
- Human review as the final quality gate

## Strategy

### The Learning Loop
For each feature:
1. **Generate** → AI builds the feature
2. **Review** → You identify what you hate about the generated code
3. **Refine** → Update prompts/rules based on learnings
4. **Regenerate** → AI improves based on feedback
5. **Repeat** → Until AI generates code you'd actually write

### Branch Structure
```

├── feature/home-page-rendering         (Start here - simple, foundational)
├── feature/basic-contact-form          (Build on home page patterns)

## Quality Evolution Process

### Per-Feature Quality Gates
1. **AI Generation Quality**: Code meets your evolving standards
2. **Functionality**: Feature works as intended
3. **Test Coverage**: Appropriate tests for the feature
4. **Performance**: No regressions introduced
5. **Human Review**: Your approval before merge

### Rule Evolution Documentation
After each feature, document:
- **What worked**: Patterns and approaches you approve
- **What didn't**: Anti-patterns to avoid
- **Refined prompts**: Updated AI generation prompts
- **Quality criteria**: Specific standards discovered
- **Testing patterns**: Testing approaches that work

### Cumulative Learning
Each feature builds on lessons from previous features:
- Prompts get more specific and effective
- Quality standards become more defined
- Testing patterns become more comprehensive
- Architecture patterns solidify

## Implementation Process

### Starting a New Feature
1. **Branch from parent**: `git checkout parent-feature && git checkout -b new-feature`
2. **Initial AI generation**: Use current best prompts
3. **Human review cycle**: Iterate until code meets standards
4. **Test and validate**: Ensure functionality works
5. **Document learnings**: Update rules and prompts
6. **Merge and move on**: Complete feature and start next

### AI Prompt Evolution
Track prompt improvements:
```markdown
## Contact Form Prompts

### V1 (Initial)
"Create a contact form component"

### V2 (After home page learnings)
"Create a contact form component using TypeScript, with proper error handling and validation"

### V3 (After form validation learnings)
"Create a contact form component using our established patterns: Result type for error handling, branded types for validation, service layer for business logic"
```

## Advantages of This Approach

### Real Learning
- Rules emerge from actual code review
- Patterns proven through implementation
- Standards based on your actual preferences

### Incremental Progress
- Each feature delivers working functionality
- No big-bang integration issues
- Steady forward progress

### AI Quality Improvement
- Prompts get better with each iteration
- AI learns your preferred patterns
- Code quality improves over time

### Maintainable Outcome
- Consistent patterns throughout codebase
- Well-tested, proven architecture
- Clear documentation of decisions

## Timeline Estimate

**Total: 2-3 weeks**
- Feature 1: 1-2 days (foundation)
- Features 2-3: 3-5 days (basic functionality)
- Features 4-6: 7-10 days (security features)
- Features 7-8: 4-6 days (integration and polish)

## Next Steps

1. **Start with home page**: `git checkout main && git checkout -b feature/home-page-rendering`
2. **Generate initial version**: Use AI to recreate home page
3. **Begin review cycle**: Identify what you like/dislike
4. **Refine and iterate**: Until AI generates code you approve
5. **Document learnings**: Capture patterns for next feature

This approach ensures rules evolve naturally from building real features, with AI quality improving through iterative refinement and human review as the ultimate quality gate.
