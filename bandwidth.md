## 📊 Breakdown of Your `.next` Folder

Here’s what matters for **Netlify bandwidth**:

| Folder/File                | Size                                         | Counts Toward Bandwidth?                       |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `.next/cache/webpack/...`  | **57M**                                      | ❌ No (build-time cache only)                   |
| `.next/server/...`         | 3.6M                                         | ✅ Possibly (SSR-related output)                |
| `.next/static/chunks/...`  | **15M**                                      | ✅ **Yes** (served via CDN)                     |
| `.next/static/media/...`   | 120K                                         | ✅ Yes                                          |
| `.next/static/css`         | 40K                                          | ✅ Yes                                          |
| `.next/static/development` | 12K                                          | ❌ No                                           |
| **Total served to users**  | \~18MB (from `.next/static` + some `server`) | ✅ This is your actual downloadable site bundle |

---

## 🧠 What This Means

* Your **actual deployed asset size is \~18 MB**, not 80 MB.
* Most of the `.next/cache` folder is just internal build cache — **Netlify does not deploy that**.
* So every **fresh visitor** (or device, or bot) is likely downloading **up to 18 MB** in total.
* With **no caching**, it only takes \~15–20 full visits or reloads to hit **279 MB bandwidth**.

## 📉 Bandwidth Math

| Scenario                              | Bandwidth Used |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| 1 new visit (cold cache)              | \~18 MB        |
| 10 fresh visits (across devices/bots) | \~180 MB       |
| 5 preview deploy views                | \~90 MB        |
| **Total**                             | **\~270 MB**   |

> That’s how you're hitting this bandwidth *without heavy real traffic*.

## ✅ How to Fix / Reduce Bandwidth

### 1. **Set Cache Headers**

If you haven’t already, create a `_headers` file in your `public/` folder (or use `netlify.toml`) with:

```text
/*.js
  Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable

/*.css
  Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable

/*.woff2
  Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable

/*.jpg
  Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable

/*.webp
  Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable
```

This ensures **repeat visitors don’t re-download** chunks, styles, images, fonts, etc.

---

### 2. **Enable GZIP/Brotli Compression**

Netlify usually does this, but confirm with:

```bash
curl -I https://yourdomain.netlify.app/_next/static/chunks/filename.js
```

Look for:

```
Content-Encoding: br
```

If you don’t see that, you might be overriding compression via custom headers.

---

### 3. **Limit Previews or Branch Deploys**

Be aware that every deploy preview or branch access = full page load = bandwidth used.

---

### 4. **Add Analytics or Bot Filtering**

Consider:

* Enabling [Netlify Analytics (paid)](https://www.netlify.com/products/analytics/)
* Using [Cloudflare Free Plan](https://www.cloudflare.com/plans) for bot filtering and bandwidth control

---

## 🧠 Final Thought

Your bandwidth usage **makes perfect sense** now:

* \~18 MB per fresh load
* Multiplied by preview deploys, multiple devices, no cache, or bots
* 279 MB is right on target

🔧 With proper headers + compression + awareness of preview deploys, **you could cut that usage by 80–90%** next month.

Let me know if you want a drop-in `_headers` or `netlify.toml` snippet and I’ll generate it for you.
